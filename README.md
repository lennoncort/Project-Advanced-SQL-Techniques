# SQL Practice & Chicago Datasets Project

This repository contains my SQL learning journey, including:

- Practice exercises with **multiple-choice SQL questions** and guided solutions.
- Hands-on queries over real-world datasets from the City of Chicago.
- Creation of relational database schemas (e.g., HR database) to practice table design, keys, and relationships.
- Advanced SQL practice with views, complex `JOINs`, `UNION`, conditional logic (`CASE`), and data cleaning.
- Scripts and notes to reinforce concepts like `JOINs`, subqueries, `GROUP BY`, aggregation, filtering, and transaction control.
